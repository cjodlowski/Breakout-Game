  <h2>Post-Mortem</h2>
  <p>The completion of this project was a combination of many things that we learned in SDL2 so far. For this project, 
    I had switched operating systems from Windows/MinGW to Debian 10 Linux, therefore, I had learned how to install programs 
    and libraries, how to include them in Linux, and how to add them to the build.py file. As I was unable to get the TTF 
    library to work in previous labs, it was nice to actually see how it works and how fonts are rendered into the window. 
    It was also my first time working with the mixer library for audio, so it was a good introduction to how audio comes 
    into play in the rest of the engine. It was interesting to customize levels and load them text files as well.</p>
  <p>If I had more time to work on this project, I would definitely organize my code a bit better. The Game::Run() method 
    could be segmented into more private helper methods- such as a method that interprets input, or a method that caps the 
    frame rate- which would help organize and visualize the steps the code is taking. This would make the code easier to 
    read and easier to debug. I would also implement more languages, as I had run out of time to do so, and did not get 
    the chance to learn how to setup the language config file. I would also fully implement the Resource Manager. The 
    Game class, does function as a resource manager, as in it is only initialized once, but there is no code in place 
    to stop others from reinitializing it. In order to polish the game more, I think it would be fun to add particle 
    effects/ animations for the ball moving as well as the bricks breaking. The ball's movement could also be changed to feel 
    more responsive, such as losing or gaining momentum as hits more bricks and the paddle. I hope to be able to hand in 
    a more complete project for the next assignment, as it was difficult to manage my time for this assignment 
    with other classes.</p>
